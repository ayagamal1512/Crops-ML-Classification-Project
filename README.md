- This repo inclueds only the project tho, will post the course content and data in a separate repo ;) 
- This course is a part of Machine Learning Course on DataCamp called **Supervised Learning with Scikit-Learn**
- Here are some highlights from the course

  1. **Classification**: introduced to classification problems and learned how to solve them using supervised learning techniques. Topics include splitting data into training and test sets, model fitting, prediction, and accuracy evaluation.applied these concepts to a churn dataset, classifying the churn status of a telecom company’s customers.
 
  2. **Regression**: The course covers regression, where you’ll build models to predict sales values using an advertising expenditure dataset. You’ll explore linear regression mechanics, performance metrics **like R-squared** and **root mean squared error**, and techniques like **k-fold cross-validation** and **regularization**.

  3. **Fine-Tuning Your Model**: After training models, you’ll evaluate them using various metrics and visualization techniques. **Hyperparameter tuning** for classification and regression models will also covered.

- In this Project I've Applied some of the concepts I've learnt from this course which are:
  - k-fold cross-validation
  - Hyperparameter tuning such as GridSearchCV
  -  performance metrics such as Precission , Recall, F1 Score and calculating Model Accuracey
  -  Visualization Techniques
  -  Preprocesssing Techniques such as Standaed Scaling
  -  Applied 3 of Classification Algorithms such as Multinomial Logistic Regression , KNN and Decision Tree.
